# Whose That? 
Simple webpage exposing the fact that I have no idea what celebrities look like. I had friends list some celebrities to me and give me one sentence that they thought would help me remember what they look like. From there I gave myself around 20 minutes to sketch and draw them without any reference images. Some of them were great, others...not so much.
